There is a clear difference between A and B aswell as AB and C in both resource end values as well as resource average values.
And altough this difference is clear, the graph curves of the a averages shows a clear and similar trend in all three cases.

This, in my opinion shows that in the simulation created sets can be used to train the prediction system on its basis.
